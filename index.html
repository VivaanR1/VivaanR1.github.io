    <h2>What is Demand?</h2>
    <p>Demand refers to the quantity of products or services that a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consumer#:~:text=%3A%20one%20that%20utilizes%20economic%20goods">consumer</a> 
      in a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/market%20economy">market</a> 
      wants to buy at a certain price. The law of demand emphasizes that as the price of a product increases, the demand for the respective product decreases; vice versa. The quantity of the goods or 
      products that consumers want to buy depends on the price of the good.</p>

      refers to a good whose demand <i>increases</i> as the consumers' income increases</li>
      <li><strong>Substitute goods</strong> are interchangeable goods due to the fact that as the price of a good increases, the demand for its substitute good
      increases.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>What is Supply?</h3>
    <p>Supply refers to the various quantities of goods/products that a seller in a market wants to produce. The law of supply emphasizes that the supply 
    of a good increases as its price increases. A seller sells a certain quantity or amount of a product/service at a specific price.</p>
