    <h2>What is Demand?</h2>
    <p>Demand refers to the quantity of products or services that a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consumer#:~:text=%3A%20one%20that%20utilizes%20economic%20goods">consumer</a> 
      in a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/market%20economy">market</a> 
      wants to buy at a certain price. The law of demand emphasizes that as the price of a product increases, the demand for the respective product decreases; vice versa. The quantity of the goods or 
      products that consumers want to buy depends on the price of the good.</p>
