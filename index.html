    <h1>The <strong>Basic</strong> Fundamentals of Supply and Demand</h1>
    <img

    <h1>What is Demand?</h1>
    <p>Demand refers to the quantity of products or services that a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consumer#:~:text=%3A%20one%20that%20utilizes%20economic%20goods">consumer</a> 
      in a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/market%20economy">market</a> 
      wants to buy at a certain price. The law of demand emphasizes that as the price of a product increases, the demand for the respective product decreases; vice versa. The quantity of the goods or 
      products that consumers want to buy depends on the price of the good.</p>
    
    <h1>Related Information</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>An <strong>inferior good</strong> refers to a good whose demand <i>decreases</i> as the consumers' income increases while a <strong>normal good</strong> 
      refers to a good whose demand <i>increases</i> as the consumers' income increases</li>
      <li><strong>Substitute goods</strong> are interchangeable goods due to the fact that as the price of a good increases, the demand for its substitute good
      increases.</li>
      <li>Demand is affected by the number of consumers in a market and the overall income of the consumers</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is Supply?</h1>
    <p>Supply refers to the various quantities of goods/products that a seller in a market wants to produce. The law of supply emphasizes that the supply 
    of a good increases as its price increases. A seller sells a certain quantity or amount of a product/service at a specific price.</p>
    <h1>Related Information</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply is affected by the number of sellers in a market, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subsidy">subsidies</a>, and government regulation </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is Equilibrium?</h1>
    <p>In a market, equilibrium refers to a price of a good that causes the amount demanded to equal the amount supplied. Both the seller and consumer will be satisfied with this price, and 
      the seller will sell a specific quantity of a good at the equilibrium price. When the amount demanded does not equal the amount supplied, it is known as disequilibrium.</p>
    <h1>Deeper Analysis on Disequilibrium</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shortage</strong>: Demand is greater than supply</li>
      <li><strong>Surplus</strong>: Supply is greater than quantity demanded</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Production Possibility Curve (PPC)</h1>
    <p>The Production Possibility Curve (PPC) is a graph indicating all the possible combinations of two goods that can 
    be produced with available resources. Opportunity cost assesses the value of the next best alternative to a good, which is 
    indicated in the PPC</p>
    <h1>How Does This Relate to Supply and Demand?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Demand Curve: On a graph, the demand curve shows how the demanded quantity of a good changes with price</li>
      
    </ul>
