    <h2>What is Demand?</h2>
    <p>Demand refers to the quantity of products or services that a consumer in a market wants to buy at a certain price. The law of demand emphasizes that as
    the price of a product increases, the demand for the respective product decreases; vice versa. The quantity of the goods or products that consumers want to 
    buy depends on the price of the good</p>
